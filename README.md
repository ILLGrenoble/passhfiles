# passhfiles

passhfiles is a PyQt-based application used to browse and manipulate files hosted by a server shielded by a [passhport](https://www.passhport.org/)/bastion server. As such, you can remove, rename, edit and/or open files/directories on your remote server (and also on your local file system). You can also drag and drop files from/to your local file system to/from the remote target. As such, passhfiles can be considered as light sftp application.
